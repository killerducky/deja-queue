## VIP user session

- [ ] 3rd playlist has no title, no thumb
- [ ] thumb with weird aspect ratio -- tabulator doing something?
- [ ] add playlist - should add to queue as PL, not individual songs
- [x] don't allow sort queue
- [ ] playlist mode -- do not autoqueue single songs
- [ ] filter X should be there even when not in focus
- [ ] click on current song thumb should not reload the page
- [ ] shift-click to insta play
- [ ] full screen playlist/database

## Playlists

- [ ] Make title, etc editable and searchable
- [x] Same video in multiple playlists
- [ ] refresh should not change current playing song

## UI

- [ ] restore window size bug
  - [ ] config if sidebar expands on hover or not
- [ ] Pasting into Add to Queue -- popup for video/playlist
- [ ] 404 thumbs
  - [ ] That one playlist has a 404 thumb?
- [ ] trick youtube to play songs back to back
- [ ] Adding new videos should update playlist/DB/etc
- [ ] Q mode dropdown is rounded weirdly
- [ ] visual bar graph or star system for ratings

## Stats/Algorithm

- [ ] Graph scores of several illustrative cases
  - [ ] User can live adjust params?!
- [ ] Lower impact of rating (due becomes relatively more important)

## Tagline ideas

“Play it like you’ve heard it before.”
“Your queue, reborn.”
“Mixes that feel familiar.”
“Because good songs deserve déjà vu.”
“DejaQueue — play it again.”
